NYT Movie Reviews Haters Collective

## Description

This project constitutes my first single-page web application using React js. It implements the *New York Times*' public API for movie reviews, providing a search engine that pulls from that API and gives users the ability to append and save their own reviews of those reviews. As a work of satire, the site encourages outrageous disapproval of *NYT* reviews, implementing a "rage" system" through which uses may accord other users' reviews points based on their stridency. These points are used to rank individual reviews and users' whole output on the "Rage Ranking" page. Users may also "honor" or pin their favorite reviews of their own on their profile page.

## Use
1. Login or register
2. Choose the Search *NYT* Reviews in the navbar to find a movie review. Select the result you wish to add your own review to.
3. Find other users' reviews by clicking the Search User Reviews link in the navbar. Searches can be done by text string or by *NYT* reviewer name. You may accord a "Rage" point to any other user's review, anywhere on the site.
4. You may view and edit your own profile and assign "Honor" placement to any of your own reviews for other users to see. You may also delete your own reviews.
